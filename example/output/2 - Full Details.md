# Should We Buy This House?
## 24364 Arcadia Street, Newhall | 1954 | 3,386 sqft | 5bd/4.5ba | 0.77 acres

**THE SHORT ANSWER:** This house needs **$60,000 - $212,000 in repairs**. It's been on the market 4+ months, price dropped 3 times ($93K total), and a buyer already backed out. We can negotiate hard, but expect a project for the first year.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: NEIGHBOR WORKSHOP - UNVERIFIED

**There may be a workshop/garage on the neighbor's property. We haven't confirmed this.**

| What To Do | If It's Noisy |
|------------|---------------|
| Visit at 7am, noon, 5pm, weekend | **WALK AWAY** |
| Listen for power tools, machinery | No price reduction fixes daily noise |
| Ask the listing agent about it | This is a deal-breaker |

| Marketing Says | Reality |
|----------------|---------|
| "Move-in ready" | $60K-$212K repairs needed |

| "Safe neighborhood" | 35% wildfire risk |

## BOTTOM LINE

**If you proceed:** Complete all pre-checks → Offer $973,000 - $997,000 → Don't exceed $1,047,000 - $1,093,000 → Don't waive contingencies → Require permit documentation → Get 2-year home warranty

**If you reconsider:** A move-in ready home costs **$345,000 less over 5 years**. Look for: built 2000+, 0.15-0.25 acre lot, single story, lower fire zone.

**My honest recommendation:** I would not recommend this house for a couple in their early 60s looking to retire. The combination of $60K-$212K repairs, $13K/year extra costs, recurring termite problems, high fire risk, and physical demands of a big lot makes this a **project house, not a retirement house**.
