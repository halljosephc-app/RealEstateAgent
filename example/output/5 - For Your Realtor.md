# ⚠️ CRITICAL: VERIFY NEIGHBOR WORKSHOP BEFORE SUBMITTING

**Unverified workshop/garage on neighboring property. Visit at 7am, noon, 5pm, weekend. Listen for power tools, machinery, vehicles. Ask listing agent.**

| Impact | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| Quality of Life | Noise destroys "peaceful retirement home" |
| Resale Value | Commercial activity reduces value |
| **Cannot Be Fixed** | **No price reduction compensates for daily noise** |

**IF ACTIVE AND NOISY: WALK AWAY. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

# WHY SELLERS SHOULD ACCEPT

| Their Position Is Weak | Leverage Points |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| 136 days on market (normal: 55) | Seller's roofer: "repairs are pointless" |
| 3 price reductions (-$93K) | FPE panel = documented fire hazard |
| Previous buyer backed out | No smoke/CO detectors (CA violation) |
| $14,535 spent on termites | Root cause items 4A, 4B never fixed |
| Redfin estimate: $1,262,380 | 35% wildfire + FPE = hard to insure |
